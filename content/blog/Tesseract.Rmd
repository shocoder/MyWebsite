## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
input <- image_read('https://images.pexels.com/photos/415359/pexels-photo-415359.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260')
plot(input)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(image_ocr(input))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
input <- image_read('https://postmediaprovince2.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/obwiki-1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=640')
plot(input)
```

Lets view the result

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(image_ocr(input))
```

Lets update the image and view the result

```{r, echo=FALSE}
text <- input %>%
  image_resize("2000x") %>%
  image_convert(type = 'Grayscale') %>%
  image_trim(fuzz = 40) %>%
  image_write(format = 'png', density = '300x300') %>%
  tesseract::ocr()

cat(text)
```

You see, this looks a little better. annoumed = announced, A((ording = According,  plagiarisf = plagiarist,mougm = thought, umil oui = until out, muck = struck

Let try to use the webcam and click an image which we can then scan.....


The code snippet below would allow us to access the webcam and click a sample image. To limit the complexity of this post, I have commented the code.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# start the webcam of your laptop
# my_stream <- stream(0) 

# capture a selfie
# my_selfie <- readNext(my_stream)

# view the image
# plot(my_selfie)

# save it as a .jpg file
# path_to_image <- paste0(tempfile(), ".jpg")
# write.Image(my_selfie, path_to_image)

# shut down the webcam
# release(my_stream)
```

Here is a sample image I captured using the code above. It is an image of the appendix of a very interesting book on data Science by Hal Daume....
You will notice enough light (this could be a flash or well lit area as you need....)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
input <- image_read('https://preview.ibb.co/hKXg9S/tsql.png')
plot(input)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(stringr)
cat(str_replace_all(image_ocr(input), "[\n]" , ""))
```
