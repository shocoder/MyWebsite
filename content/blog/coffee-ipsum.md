In the world of programming, I have come across 2 very distinct kinds of people who I refer as 

1.	The Artists  
2.	The Hustlers    

In this post, I am going to use the R programming language as reference to demonstrate features of the mentioned programmers extraordinaire.   

Heads up: I am a proud hustler who loves visiting the gallery and works on his art in the shadows. Any bias is definitely subject to scrutiny by current artists.  

The Artist  
1.  	Critiques the documentation of a library before trying to seek answers via stackoverflow.  
2.  	Has a good understanding of the internals of a programming language and probably speaks C/C++/GO with ease.  
3.  	Has a favorite programming language.  
4.  	Contributes to the open source community regularly.  
5.  	Writes code that is elegant, high performance, easy to understand and appreciate. True art!  

The Hustler  
1.	Stackoverflow is king. If they world has the answers, then they just seek them.  
2.	Has a fair understanding of multiple languages. More like a jack of all trades and master of “some”.  
3.	Does not usually prefer a language, is more flexible, and uses the right weapon from an available arsenal (Arsenal, not Barcelona).  
4.	Loves to import libraries and rarely contributes to the community.  
5.	Writes code that is of decent quality and does the job.

Although artists are the lifelines which allow the open-source community to thrive, Hustlers play a major role in propagating the language and offer versatility to a team. They present more complex challenges for the artists to solve, while they save the world with the available tools.  

It is a fact that the number of hustlers using R or any other programming language is higher than artists, but a beautiful ecosystem is where there is a good balance of them both, with each of them trying to learn the positives of the other.  

Few tips to start being more “artsy”  
1.	Work on the quality of your code. Picture every line you write being played at a cinema near you.  
2.	Invest time in learning how a language actually works and start contributing to the community.  

Few tips to start being more “Hustly”  
1.	Be open to change. Lay some additional emphasis on “getting things done” rather than absolute perfection.
