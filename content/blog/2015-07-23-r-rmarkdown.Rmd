# R Markdown

Few tips to start being more “artsy”  
1.	Work on the quality of your code. Picture every line you write being played at a cinema near you.  
2.	Invest time in learning how a language actually works and start contributing to the community.  



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```


# Chill

You can watch videos, for example:

<div class="video">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bAJ1WTGNISk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
