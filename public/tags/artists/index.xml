      <description>In the world of programming, I have come across 2 very distinct kinds of people who I refer as
 The Artists
 The Hustlers
  In this post, I am going to use the R programming language as reference to demonstrate features of the mentioned programmers extraordinaire.
Heads up: I am a proud hustler who loves visiting the gallery and works on his art in the shadows. Any bias is definitely subject to scrutiny by current artists.</description>
